# mruby-serverspec-libspecinfra

This is another implementation of [syucream/mruby-serverspec](https://github.com/syucream/mruby-serverspec) .

This is a proof concept of the product based on [libspecinfra](https://github.com/libspecinfra/specinfra) .

I did not start developing this mrbgem by forking syucream/mruby-serverspec because libspecinfra is not yet sufficient to cover the functions of syucream/mruby-serverspec.

But when libspecinfra will have sufficient functions, I will obsolete this mrbgem and fork syucream/mruby-serverspec to make it use libspecinfra.
